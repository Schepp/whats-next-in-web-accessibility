### What is a Popover?

A **popover** is a transient UI element that appears in relation to another element ‚Äì often for:

- Tooltips
- Dropdown menus
- Off-canvas menus
- Contextual help

### Native Popovers in HTML

With the new `popover` attribute, HTML supports native popovers:

```html
<button popovertarget="menu">Open menu</button>

<div id="menu" popover>
  <p>Menu content here</p>
</div>
```

<button popovertarget="menu">Open menu</button>

<div id="menu" popover>
  <p>Menu content here</p>
</div>

(there is also a new `showPopover()` method and a `:popover-open` CSS selector)

‚úÖ Automatically positioned  
‚úÖ Keyboard accessible

### Implicit Accessibility Features

#### 1. Focus Management

- When shown, the popover **receives focus**
- When dismissed, focus returns to the **triggering element**

---

#### 2. Escape to Dismiss

- Popovers are automatically closed when:
  - Pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd>
  - Clicking outside

No extra scripting needed for this.

<button popovertarget="menu2">Open menu</button>

<div id="menu2" popover>
  <p>Menu content here</p>
</div>
