The accessibility of user interfaces on the web continues to evolve — both through new HTML, CSS, ARIA features and through better platform integration. In this session, we take a closer look at current proposals like `ariaNotify()`, `hidden="until-found"`, native popovers, exclusive accordions, CSS carousels, and CSS reading-flow. We’ll explore how these features are designed to improve support for screen readers, keyboard navigation, and find-in-page behavior — and what developers need to know to implement them effectively.

> Christian Schaefer (https://schepp.dev / https://bsky.app/profile/schepp.dev / https://mastodon.social/@Schepp / https://www.linkedin.com/in/derschepp/), known as "Schepp", is a freelance frontend developer from Düsseldorf, Germany. Instead of hacking around with JS-Frameworks as almost every other frontend developer currently does, he works on traditional server-rendered component-based systems, uses bleeding edge CSS, has an eye on accessibility as well as the loading and runtime performance of a site. And then he also organizes a meetup (https://www.css.cafe/) and co-hosts a podcast (https://workingdraft.de/).
